          India’s R&D spending (0.8% of the GDP) is much lower compared to other countries with similar 
          scale and aspirations. To ensure that the R&D spends are utilized better, Open Science Stack 
          is designing and building the specifications need to implement a general-purpose robotic 
          science computer. 
          </p>

          <p>
          Using OSS specifications, we are building a reference implementation of “Open Science Lab”. 
          The goal is to make cloud-based labs accessible to researchers across India and to let them 
          run their wet lab experiments in an automated manner in a remote physical lab. The system will 
          handle all aspects of running experiments – including handling materials (compounds, molecules, 
          reagents, etc.), moving inputs and samples (test-tubes, well-plates, etc.), operating 
          instruments, setting experimental parameters, waste disposal, etc. in a fully automated 
          manner with the help of robots.

            <p>
              In India,  more than 38 million high school students and 16 million senior school students study science. 
              However, as per NCERT survey, as many as 65% schools for senior students don’t have adequate science 
              labs -- even for the students who have opted to study science in Classes 11th and 12th! Moreover, 
              71% of Class 9th and 10th students in India don’t have access to adequate science labs. 
            </p>

            <p>
              Consequently, students (and teachers) resort to "learning by rote" (typically) or to "learning by example" 
              (in the best case, when self-motivated teachers take personal initiative to make the topic more interesting). 
              In science pedagogy, "learning by doing" is known to be more effective. To provide every student in India 
              the opportunity to learn by doing their own experiments and, thereby, to experience the joy of science, 
              we are building cloud-based Open Science Labs (OSL) so that they can be made available to school students.              
            </p>

            <p>
              OSL provides anytime and anywhere access to fully-equipped science labs to students. By providing 
              opportunities to students to do science experiments with real equipment and to play with them in 
              a controlled environment (with no risk of them breaking or getting sploit), OSL helps to strengthen 
              students’ scientific foundations. OSL also enables teachers to fuel the spark of scientific inquiry 
              by guiding interested students to define and run a large variety of science experiments to explore 
              and understand the world around them.
